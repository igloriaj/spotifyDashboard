# Spotify Analytics Dashboard
<p>
  This project is for end-to-end data processing and analysis of my personal Spotify streaming data for 2025. I am using Python to ingest and clean the JSON data,
  SQLite to transform and analyze the data, and Power BI to create an interactive and informative visualization dashboard.

  As a passionate music fan and data analysis enthusiast, I am super excited to dive into my streaming history and draw interesting insights into my habits as a music listener.
